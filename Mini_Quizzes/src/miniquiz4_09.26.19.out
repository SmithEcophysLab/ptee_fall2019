\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.1}{A recent article by Bastin et al. \(full citation below\) posited that the Earth could hold an additional 0.9 billion hectares of trees. The authors then used carbon cycle equations for NPP to suggest that this could result in an increase in carbon stored on land by 205 Gt \(see Figure 1 below\). The authors argue could drastically offset human emissions \(300 Gt to date\). However, this paper has been criticized for not considering other carbon cycle and non-carbon cycle impacts to ecosystems. Use the back of this page to create a systems diagram to explore what these impacts might be. From your diagram, do you support reforesting the Earth; why or why not?}{}% 1
