How might use of fertilizer impact ecosystem services?}{}% 1
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.2}{Did you find any negative ecosystem service impacts in response to question 1? If so, how could we avoid these while maintaining crop productivity?}{}% 2
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{How might you expect fertilizer use to impact microbial \(bacterial and fungal\) communities? How might this impact the ecosystem?}{}% 3
