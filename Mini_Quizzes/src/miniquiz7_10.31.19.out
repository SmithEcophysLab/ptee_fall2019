\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.1}{A primary issue in all of science is the "one Earth" problem. This states that scientists cannot fully predict the impact of anthropogenic activity on ecosystem services because we do not have a second Earth to experiment with. Nonetheless, we need these predictions in order to best prepare humanity for the future. \040 Pick an ecosystem service and a time and spatial scale \(e.g., something important to you\). Design a study that will allow you to predict how this service will change in the future at the scale you chose. Assume you have unlimited resources. Note the benefits and any limitations to your design.}{}% 1
