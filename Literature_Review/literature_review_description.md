# Expanded description and suggestions for a successful literature review
This guide will walk you through developing, carrying out, and disseminating a
scientific literature review. 

These ideas are based on an 
[excellent article by Marco Pautasso](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3715443/).

Pautasso M. 2013. Ten simple rules for writing a literature review. PLoS 
computational biology 9: e1003149â€“e1003149.

## 1. Start by defining a question or problem
This is an import and, sometimes difficult, step. Your question/problem should be:
- interesting to you! You'll be doing a lot of reading, so you'll want a topic that 
sparks your interest. Something related to current or future career aspirations are great!
- an important aspect of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology. You'll want your audience to be
interested as well. Also, unimportant topics may not have much literature written about them.

In some cases, you may have to return to the drawing board to adjust your question or problem.
Don't worry, that is perfectly normal! Seek help from Dr. Smith and others if you are
struggling with this.

**Remember: you are reviewing a question or a problem, not
a single article.**

## 2. Define the sections of your review as early as possible
Your review will typically start with an *Introduction* and end with a *Conclusion*
section. In between, you will have different sections, possibly with subsections 
related to your main topic.
It will help if you can try to define these are early as possible as you will be able to
target your reading and writing.

## 3. Scour the literature and keep track of what you read
You'll need to read a lot of papers to have a successful review. Some of which may never
even make it into your final review. Design a system to keep track of what you read.
This might include a folder where you save PDFs of papers (printed or saved on your computer). 
You may also consider
using a reference manager such as Medeley to keep track of your papers and save their
citations (this makes doing your citations in your paper a lot easier later).
I find it nice to have different folders related to the different sections in your review.

## 4. Take copious notes
A pen and highlighter are your best friends! When reading, make sure to take notes and highlight
sections that you can return to later. If you have the sections of your review planned out,
one strategy is to use different colored highlighters to highlight points that
will be of use to different sections.

## 5. Keep the review focused
It will be easy to get side tracked, but try your best not to. Keep your reading and writing
focused on your main topic and try to avoid deviations from this wherever possible.

## 6. Be critical
Not everything published in the literature needs to be taken as gospel. Feel free to editorialize
and even criticize previous work. However, make sure you have some facts to back up
your critical statements. The best reviews are those that challenge conventional thinking
on a topic.

## 7. Use a logical flow
Your sections should be able to stand on their own, but there should be a logical and
consistent flow amongst the sections. That is, the first main section should follow from
the introduction, the second section should follow from the first, and so on.

## 8. Get as much feedback as you can
Make use of the resources you have to get feedback at all stages of the process. These include:
- Dr. Smith. I love talking science, so let's chat! We can meet to just bounce ideas around
and/or focus on targeted aspects of your review.
- Your classmates. Your classmates are great resources to talk through ideas with you.
They have a range of background and expertise that could be very useful as you flesh out your ideas.
- Your friends outside of class. It's often great to talk through ideas with a "lay person."
This can be a way to see whether you are effectively communicating ideas.
- [The University Writing Center](http://uwc.ttu.edu/). Did you know we have a writing center?
There are people there to help with your writing needs.
- [The University Library](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/). We also have a great library
that can assist in finding resources. For instance, if there is an article you can't access,
just request it through [inter-library loan](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/library/docdel/index.php)!

## 9. Be up to date, but don't forget older studies
Try to make use of the most recent literature, but keep in mind that some older studies
can be very useful!

## 10. Try to have fun with this
This project will inevitably become a burden, but try not to let that overwhelm you. 
Remember that, by researching and writing about
your important and interesting question/problem, 
you are be laying the groundwork for a solution.
