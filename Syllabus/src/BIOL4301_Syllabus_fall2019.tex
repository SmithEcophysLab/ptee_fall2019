\section{Course Description}
Students in this course will learn the fundamentals of ecosystem ecology.
This will include interactions between biological organisms and themselves as well as
their environment. Concepts taught will include water and energy cycling as well as carbon
and nutrient flows in natural and managed systems.
This will include aboveground and belowground processes.
As ecosystem ecology is the largest scale of ecology, the class will also cover necessary
concepts of individual, population, and community ecology.
Spatial extent of processes will extend to the globe. Temporal extent will extend to 
millenia. The class will consider applied aspects of global change and human decision making.
Students will be evaluated on their 
ability to discuss and disseminate course topics.

The course is part of a TTU-wide \textit{Creating Livable Futures} initiative.
The purpose of the initiative is to create opportunities for students to hear and
disseminate information related to global sustainability. More information on the
initiative is listed below.

\section{Course Materials}
All course materials, including lecture slides, readings, activities, and code 
will be posted to a GitHub repository for the course.
The primary repository address is
\url{https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/ptee_fall2019}.
The repository will include the syllabus, daily class notes, readings, and mini-quizzes.
The repository will also include other miscellaneous class materials as the semester
progresses. A README file will contain information on the repository, including
links to different sections at 
\url{https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/ptee_fall2019/README.md}.

\section{Learning Objective}
This course will broadly focus on understanding the interactions between biological
organisms and their environment that drive cycles of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients
at local to global scales.
An emphasis will be placed on how these processes influence humanity in a changing world.
Applied concepts will consider human decisions as a means to reduce the negative impact
of global change. Class activities will be based on discussion and dissemination of ideas, 
including classic and recent scientific literature. 
Topics will be flexible and modified to match student interests where possible.
Note that broad course objectives meet the objectives of the \textit{Creating Livable Futures}
initiative (more information below).

\section{Attendance Policy}
Attendance will not be taken, but is strongly recommended. 
In class activity points will only be granted if students are in class.
Makeups will not be granted.

\section{Course Assessment}
\subsection{\textit{Participation and Engagement}}
Being an active and engaged participant in the class will benefit your understanding
of material as well as your peers'. Examples include asking questions, providing feedback,
and facilitating discussion.

\subsection{\textit{Mini-quizzes}}
Short “quizzes” will be given in class each week (typically on Thursdays). 
These quizzes will be used to stimulate discussion and to assess how well 
prior concepts were understood by the class. 
These will be graded for completion and participation in the ensuing class discussion.

\subsection{\textit{Reading feedback}}
Each week students will be required to read a a section of the book 
and produce a short summary as well as two questions that arose during their 
reading. 

\subsection{\textit{In-class discussion lead and feedback}}
Each student will be required to lead one Thursday discussion on recent literature. 
This will involve presenting the article 
and leading a discussion related to the article. Students must read some of the cited
literature integral to the study 
in order to answer relevant questions brought forth during the discussion.

Discussion leads will be done in groups of 2-3 students, subject to enrollment. Paper
suggestions will be provided by Dr. Smith, but substitutions can be made if approved
beforehand.

Students not leading the current week’s 
discussion will be required to produce a summary and 
develop two questions based on each week’s article.

\subsection{\textit{Literature review}}
The primary semester project will be to produce a literature review on a topic 
of the student's choice.
Broadly, the review should address a question or problem related 
to ecosystem ecology. The review should be forward thinking, in that it forms the
basis for understanding ecosystem processes, including responses and/or feedbacks,
moving forward.

Students will first present their idea for their review 
to the class. The class will provide feedback. Students will then produce and present 
their review to the class at the end of the semester. This project must be done 
in groups of up to 3 students. Students are encouraged to receive help and guidance 
from the instructor as well as the class at large. 

The review will be assessed for completeness, breadth, originality, and presentation.
Students must have their project OKed by the instructor before beginning. Field, lab,
or greenhouse space may be used, subject to availability.

Please contact Dr. Smith if you plan to miss class for a university function 
\textit{prior to class}. If class is missed due to an illness, 
please let Dr. Smith know as soon as possible and provide Dr. Smith with 
a signed doctor’s note by the start of the next class period.

\section{Special Considerations}
\subsection{Disabling Condition}
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to 
meet the course requirements should contact Dr. Smith as soon as possible to make 
any necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Student 
Disability Services. Please note instructors are not 
allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification 
from Student Disability Services has been provided. For additional information, you may 
contact the Student Disability Services office at 335 West Hall or 806-742-2405.

\subsection{Religious Holy Days}
"Religious holy day" means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are 
exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.
A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known 
in writing to the instructor prior to the absence. A student who is absent from classes 
for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or 
complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.
A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor 
may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.

\section{Academic Integrity}
As stated in the Texas Tech University catalog, “The attempt of any students to present 
as their own work that they have not honestly performed is regarded by the faculty and 
administration as a serious offense and renders the offenses liable to serious 
consequences, possibly suspension.” This statement applies to cheating in whatever 
manner, including plagiarism.

\section{Creating Livable Futures}
This class is part of a campus-wide initiative called Creating Livable Futures, 
which is sponsored in part by the Texas Tech Center for Global Communication. 
As such, one of our objectives is to prepare you to communicate, 
in a fully interdisciplinary and global way, the challenges posed by pressing issues 
that speak to our collective wellbeing and sustainability. You will be asked to translate 
and communicate the work of leading thinkers on sustainability, and to expand discussing 
those materials through research experience and experiential learning.
These objectives will be met through discussion leads and the review paper. 

Your progress in communicating about global issues will be evaluated according to the 
Center for Global Communication rubric, so you will be invited to participate 
in one or more Creating Livable Futures activities outside of class that will 
complement class content. 
Planned Creating Livable Futures activities include participating in and attending 
speaker events and conferences, edit-a-thons, blogging and publication opportunities, 
student organizations, a book club, and even small scholarship opportunities for research. 

You’ll be informed of relevant opportunities and activities as they arise over 
the course of the semester.
