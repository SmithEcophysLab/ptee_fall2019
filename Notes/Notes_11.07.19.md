## Post class notes
I had the students take the quiz then pair up and steal answers.
Any answer they had to change was starred. They then got into groups of 4
and did the same thing, but this time with a double star. In the final round,
they were allowed to use any resource available to them and triple star
any answer they got in this round. This exercise went well and achieved two goals: (1)
the students realized that they actually retained a lot of information and (2) they realized
that using sources helps solve problems; just like real science!
